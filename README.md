```lrc
[00:00.59] He's right, I am a murderer
[00:04.28] But until six months ago, I was just an ordinary high school girl
[00:10.13] Do you remember what we promised?
[00:12.96] We're not gonna lose anyone else close to us again
[00:16.50] We swore that we would always be there for each other
[00:22.57] No matter what happens though, I promise that I'll protect you
[00:28.18] If you were a boy
[00:29.11] I would have actually have fallen for you if you were careful
[00:31.57] Oh, c'mon, well maybe I'm the one who should have a crush on you
